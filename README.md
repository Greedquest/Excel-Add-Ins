# Excel-Add-Ins
Place to store utility Add-Ins I develop and/or use in Excel

To use these Add-ins you'll need to go to File>Options>Add-Ins>Manage: Excel Add-Ins>Go to bring up the Add-Ins dialog window. From there click the Browse... button and navigate to where you saved the add-in. Once done the add-in will be available when you need to use them.
